### Welcome! 👋

Hello. I'm Mike. I'm a former math teacher turned software engineer.

- 🔎 I’m looking for my first software development role.
- 🔨 C++ is my favorite but I enjoy using a variety of languages.
- 📚 I'm currently studying applied math and computer science and will apply to a MS CS program March 2024.
- 💪 I have a strong math foundation.
- 🌱 Let me know if you'd like to collaborate on a project. Gotta build that portfolio!
  
- 🌞 Life is good. Let's get after it!
